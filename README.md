## Advanced-Calculator
**Easy to Perform Binary to Decimal / Decimal to Binary / Hexa to Binary / Binary to Hexa / Equation**

**PROBLEM DEFINITION:**
These days our generation is moving towards advance technology thatâ€™s why we
have designed this advance calculator, because it takes a lot of time for a person to
do a paper work for complex calculations when he has to solve a tricky problem which
will consume his quality time, this advance calculator will solve his problem in many
way, saves a lot of time and serve as a good problem solving application.

**SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM:**
A Fully featured scientific calculator with proper operator proceedings is implemented
Including functions of proper calculation of hexadecimal and binary conversions function
of equations which will ease the problem very precisely.
The calculator is written in c language and you are welcome to view the source code of
this calculator.
This program also uses math.h library function to perform specific which it wants to
perform while solving the problem.


**BASIC CALCULATIONS:**

**BINARY TO DECIMAL CONVERSION:**
This function will give the decimal value when the system ask you to enter the binary
value,in this function we have used the loops with proper operator proceedings
regarding calculations.


**DECIMAL TO BINARY CONVERSION:**
This program also include a function of decimal to binary, we have used loops in this
function because to covert the number we must use to loop to reduce the value
therefore to convert it.

**HEXADECIMAL CONVERSION:**
There are two functions regarding this statement one will convert the binary number to
decimal and other functions will operates vice versa, in this case we have used the loop
structure and cases as well to indicate that the hexadecimal values from 10 onwards are
indicated by A to F till 15.


**EQUATION:**
This function is the most advanced function of this calculator, this function also used a
loop in order to find a value of x when function of x is given the scope is set to n
numbers which will be asked to the user, and he sets the scope to his wish and function
calculates the function of x till that value.

**Algorithm/Pseudo Code and Flowchart of all function working is avaliable in Project Word documents**
